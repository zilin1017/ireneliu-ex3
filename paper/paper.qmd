# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @talia, @opendatatorotno, and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-mydatasection



# Data {#sec-mydatasection}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-marriage), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-marriage
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = marriage_licenses)) +
  geom_point()

```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)
